So basically pom is a design pattern 
We need two class one for method implemention
second for execution purpose 

CLASS ONE :-

1. CONSTRUCTER 
	
	initialize = WebDriver.....[ Interface ] + PageFactory.initElement ();.....[Class + method]

2. FIND AND CREATE 
	
	find the webElement and create object(variable) for it
	
3. CREATE METHODS
	
	1.create separate respective methods for each test case 
	2.According to test case build the logic try to convert those logic into boolean value + use base utility classes + external test-data
	3.Make sure each method return type should be boolean + close whatever open file connections etc 
	
	
CLASS SECOND :-

	1. WebDriver launch + disiable notification + add implicitly wait + maximize the window ..[@ Before class]
	2. Import all methods from class one + put assertions + set priority ..[@Test]
	3. close the open browser..[@After class]
	
PROJECT XML FILE :-
	
	1. Add listeners class 
	2. do cross browsing (using parameter)
	
EXTRA FOLDER :-
	
	1. To store Report purpose
	2. To store Failed Screen Shot Purpose 
	3. To store Test data File (Excel,Json etc) Purpose
